Welcome,

To run the program from visual studio create a build folder and use CMake.
Controls are displayed in game but are also:
WASD to move
Space to jump

Very small minor linker error inconsistently appears if run from visual studio. If it appears just re-run the and this seems to fix it. Happens about one in 100 runs.
